# Week 4 Mini Project - GitHub Actions Matrix Build 

## Summary
In this project I created a GitHub Actions Matrix Build that tests at least 3 versions of Python. 

## Coding specifics
  - Main.py
      - Function that calculates the number of wine ratings, sum, average, median, and standard deviation. Creates a markdown with these            statistics
      - Creates a histogram that plots the frequency of wine ratings, saved as wine_rating.png
  - test_main.py tests the descriptive statistics to assert that the data was correct

## Visualization of the distribution of wine ratings
Found in wine_rating.png
